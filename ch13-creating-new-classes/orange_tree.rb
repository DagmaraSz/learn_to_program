=begin
Make an OrangeTree class that has a height method that returns
its height and a one_year_passes method that, when called, ages the tree one
year. Each year the tree grows taller (however much you think an orange
tree should grow in a year), and after some number of years (again, your
call) the tree should die. For the first few years, it should not produce
fruit, but after a while it should, and I guess that older trees produce
more each year than younger treesâ€¦whatever you think makes the most
sense. And, of course, you should be able to count_the_oranges (which returns
the number of oranges on the tree) and pick_an_orange (which reduces the
@orange_count by 1 and returns a string telling you how delicious the orange
was, or else it just tells you that there are no more oranges to pick this
year). Make sure any oranges you donâ€™t pick one year fall off before the
next year.

# in order to pass the rspec please follow the below rates of growth, orange production and age of death.
# have your OrangeTree grow by 0.4 per year.
# have it produce no oranges in its first 5 years
# starting in its sixth year have it produce oranges at a rate of (height * 15 - 25) per year.
# have the tree die after 25 years.
# check out the rspec spec/ch13/orange_tree_spec.rb to see what strings we're looking for in the responses.
